Overview
========

The :doc:`Enumerations </reference/Enumerations/index>` package contains enumerations for various aspects of engineering information in a P\&ID. Enumerations that are relevant for P\&ID graphics only are part of the :doc:`Graphics </reference/Graphics/index>` package.

For example, the :doc:`LocationClassification </reference/Enumerations/LocationClassification>` enumeration provides four enumeration literals: :ref:`NULL <dexpi-Enumerations-LocationClassification-NULL>` (the :ref:`null value <dexpi-concept-null-value>` for this enumeration), :ref:`CentralLocation <dexpi-Enumerations-LocationClassification-CentralLocation>`, :ref:`ControlPanel <dexpi-Enumerations-LocationClassification-ControlPanel>`, and :ref:`Field <dexpi-Enumerations-LocationClassification-Field>`. :doc:`LocationClassification </reference/Enumerations/LocationClassification>` is used as the type of the :ref:`Location <dexpi-Instrumentation-ProcessInstrumentationFunction-Location>` attribute of :doc:`ProcessInstrumentationFunction </reference/Instrumentation/ProcessInstrumentationFunction>`.
