   There is no direct implementation of :doc:`DirectPipingConnection </reference/Piping/DirectPipingConnection>` in Proteus Schema. A :doc:`DirectPipingConnection </reference/Piping/DirectPipingConnection>` rather corresponds to cases where Proteus Schema allows direct connections between piping-related items without a ``<CenterLine>`` element (corresponding to a :doc:`Pipe </reference/Piping/Pipe>`\ ) between, e.g., between two :doc:`PipingComponents </reference/Piping/PipingComponent>` or between a :doc:`PipingComponent </reference/Piping/PipingComponent>` and a :doc:`PropertyBreak </reference/Piping/PropertyBreak>`.
