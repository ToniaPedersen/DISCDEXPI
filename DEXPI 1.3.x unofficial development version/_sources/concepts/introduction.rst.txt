Introduction
============

The DEXPI Initiative (Data EXchange in the Process Industry) is a working
party of ProcessNet, which is a joint initiative of DECHEMA and VDI-GVC:

	"ProcessNet is the German platform for chemical engineering with more than
	5,000 members. Experts from the sciences, industry and administration
	exchange ideas and experience, discuss current topics and identify new
	scientific trends. ProcessNet is a joint initiative of DECHEMA and VDI-GVC.

	ProcessNet organises numerous events targeting the interdisciplinary and
	cross-sectoral exchange of information. The most prominent conference is
	the ProcessNet Annual Meeting attracting more than 1,000 participants. The
	wide variety of thematically structured committees deal with scientific and
	technical problems and issues of paramount technological and societal
	relevance, they also trigger funding policy initiatives. ProcessNet is the
	national contact point for international co-operations. Participation in
	ProcessNet is open to all members of DECHEMA and/or	VDI-GVC."

Motivation for DEXPI
--------------------

Due to the lack of interoperability between CAE [1]_ (and other) systems,
companies today face high efforts in data exchange while working together to
execute projects for planning, construction and operation of process plants.
Parties typically exchanging data in such projects are e.g. EP/EPCs [2]_,
owner-operators, and vendors, but also site services and authorities. One of
the main reasons for this high effort is the lack of an agreed understanding
across the different systems, e.g. by means of a commonly used standard for
data exchange in the process industry. To become more efficient during
planning, construction and operation of plants, a data exchange model based on
the ISO 15926 standard shall be established.


----------
Objectives
----------

The objective is to develop and promote a general method for data exchange,
data interoperability and data integration for the process industry covering
all phases of the lifecycle of a (petro-)chemical plant, ranging from
specification of functional requirements to assets in operation. This method
shall cover formats and content to address various problems seen today:

* Avoid format conversions (and thereby data loss) when passing engineering
  data and documents across CAE system boundaries.

* Make handover of engineering data during and at the end of a project easy and
  cost-effective.

* Reduce data exchange barriers between different CAE systems or different
  customizations of the same CAE systems.

* Support long-term storage of plant data in a CAE system independent format.
  Today's commonly used standard formats like PDF don't support value added
  improvements or at best insufficiently.

* Simplify co-existence of different CAE systems within a company, e.g. due to
  mergers/acquisitions or different priorities in different business units.


------------
Expectations
------------

EP/EPCs, suppliers and owner operators want to minimize the cost for handling
engineering data during planning, construction and operation of process plants
between different CAE systems and they want to create opportunities for new
value-added functions base on the available engineering data. Therefore the CAE
vendors will implement a valid global standard for data exchange into their CAE
systems. In a first phase, data exchange will cover graphics, topology of the
full P&ID [3]_ and attributes of the discrete P&ID components.

The involved owner/operator companies from the DEXPI Initiative will define a
common data model which is based on the ISO 15926 standard. The resulting data
model will be aligned with other projects in the global ISO 15926 community.
The CAE vendors will implement this common data model as
the basis for data exchange and will deliver it as part of their default system
configuration. In addition, it is expected that CAE vendors agree on a common
exchange format for the graphical representation of a P&ID and implement the
result in their systems as well. The involved companies expect a constructive
team work of the CAE vendors during the definition of the common ISO 15926
conformant data model.

Objective of the first phase of the initiative is the transfer of a P&ID from
one P&ID system to another P&ID system. The data transfer must include
graphics, symbols, topology, all engineering attributes, enumerations, select
lists etc. to enable seamless continuation of work on the P&ID in the
destination system. Transfer of engineering data over the full life cycle of a
plant between different CAE tools, e.g. from simulation to basic/detail
engineering up to operations and maintenance may be covered in subsequent
phases.
